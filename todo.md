# Todo

## Definitely
- Build CLI
  - picarro read
  - picarro split
  - picarro stich
  - picarro fit
- Deal with time zones
- Relabel data using transformation (solenoid#, time span) -> label

## Maybe later

- Be more permissive about versions of dependencies (currently requiring latest version of pandas, matplotlib, scipy, click, ...)
- Deal with time adjustments? If the Picarro computer has the wrong time setting, it could be nice to be able to apply an offset
